All my work related to data science, machine learning, deep learning and similar.

The datasets/models and other large files can be downloaded from my [google-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gS6SH6Vi3jIPEofzTzb6I4AGo33rGwkp?usp=sharing).

You can find a summary of each of the projects in their folders.

1. Spam detection models evaluation

The task was to evaluate and measure different classification models in task of detecting spam e-mails based on data from SpamAssasin. The task was to tune classifiers in order to achieve desired recall and precision instead of accuracy. The data was also a little imbalance and many different approaches were used to conduct the sensitivity studies.

2. Toxic text classification visualisations

Big data visualisations - multiclassification of 6 types of toxicity: ['toxic', 'severe_toxic', 'obscene', 'threat', 'insult', 'identity_hate'].

3. K-NN evaluation and benchmarks

Benchmark K-NN classifier in supporting identification of myocardial infarction.

4. ARQ protocol analysis in Matlab

Benchmark of ARQ protocol used in data correction during transmission.

5. ETL and OLAP multidimensional data analysis

Multidimensional analysis with SSIS and SSAS of dean's office data.
